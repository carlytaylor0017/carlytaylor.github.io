## Selected Projects

[Deep Learning for Organic Chemistry](https://carlytaylor0017.github.io/csk/)

*A model trained to extract features (shapes, stereochemistry, spectral data) from custom GAN generated images of chemical structures, linked to a recurrent neural network to generate SMILES outputs. Model can predict information about both handwritten and computer-generated data.*

[Predicting User Churn](https://carlytaylor0017.github.io/predicting_churn/)

*Predicting user churn of a ride-share service and recommendations for improving user retention.*

[Modeling Diamond Prices](https://carlytaylor0017.github.io/diamond_dataset/)

*Predict prices of diamonds, given an input file with diamond features.*
